# Angular Boilerplate :flashlight:

You can use FontAwesome 5, Bootstrap 4, Bourbon & Saffron right off the bat.

Saffron animations build out all major polyfills on `ng serve`.

## How To Use
`cd ng-boiler && npm i && ng serve` will set up the modules and libraries needed, and spin up a local dev server at [localhost:4200](localhost:4200).

### Extra 3rd party library added!
MDBootstrap was just now added. I have not tested it thoroughly, but it seems promising and may indeed install correctly with the above How To directions. Good luck. If it doens't work, consider modifying the icky config files manually again because [this is all I did](https://mdbootstrap.com/angular/5min-quickstart/).
